# Fraggel Rock Crystal Collector

This project serves as an example of utilizing jQuery to compile a random number guessing Game.

The user is presented with a randomly generated target number between 19 and 120. They will also view 4 crystals of dif
The goal of the game is to add up the randomly assigned numbers from these crystals, by clicking on the image and acquiring a total number that equals the random target number.

This project is a great way to practice functions in jQuery and understanding what creative liberties you have when using Bootstrap.

Get started by psuedo coding your process, and compiling folders for all your work. Don't forget link the css and javascript files to your html page, and look up helpful jQuery language.
Get creative and choose a fun theme!

tips that I need to remember: -EACH crystal needs a math random function so that it'll change its value after every win or loss.
